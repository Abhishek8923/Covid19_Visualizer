This was done at a very initial stage of COVID-19 like when talks were "OMG! In our state the total number of cases reached is 58. " . Yeah that time. 

I always used to Google search "How many corona virus cases in India ?" Like that , so i made this using Bootstrap and I could luckly find some API's which provide total number of cases.

### Technical Stack Used
